    "The dataset used in this assignment is extracted from the textbook namely **Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers (7th Edition)** by Montgomery et al.; the dataset is in Chapter 1, p.13 and p.14. The data in this dataset were collected in an observational study in a semiconductor manufacturing plant. The variables reported in this dataset are **pull strength**, **wire length**, and **die height**. The objective of this study is to predict the pull strength based on the length of the wire and the height of the die. \n"

The write up does not have to be too long, I expect it to be less than a page (not counting the plots). Remember the followings:\n",
