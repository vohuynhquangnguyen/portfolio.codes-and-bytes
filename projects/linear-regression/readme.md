# Linear Regression from scratch
## Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in data science and machine learning. It is utilized for predicting continuous variables (also called dependent variables or responses) using one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables or factors).

The process of building a linear regression model involves the following steps:
1. Hypothesize the form of the model.
2. Collect the sample data.
3. Use the sample data to estimate unknown parameters in the model.
4. Specify the probability distribution of the error term, and estimate any unknown parameters of this distribution. Also, check the validity of each assumption made about the probability distribution. 
5. Statistically check the usefulness of the model.
6. When satisfied that the model is useful, use it for prediction, estimation, and so on.

In the following sections, we will delve into three core topics of linear regression: simple linear regression (SLR), multiple linear regression (MLR), and logistic regression (LR).

## Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
The demonstration of SLR on the TAMPALMS dataset can be found [here]().
