# Probability for Machine Learning and Data Science
## Introduction
This folder contains lecture notes as well as solutions to exercises of what I have learnt about probability during my own self-learning of this subject. Here are some disclaimers:
1. Only the topics in linear algebra that is applicable for Machine Learning and Data Science are included in this folder.
2. The contents are based on:


## Practicalities
The structure of this folder is as follows:
- `slides`: this is where the course lecture slides are located.
- `assignment`: this is where the solutions to exercises of all the courses are located.
- `notes`: this is where the notes taken during these courses are located.
