This folder contains lecture notes as well as solutions to exercises of what I have learnt about linear algebra:
1. Only the topics in linear algebra that is applicable for Machine Learning and Data Science are included in this folder.
2. The contents are based on:
    * The [Linear Algebra course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra/home/) offered by deeplearning.ai in Coursera.
    * The two courses **MS-A001 Matrix Algebra** and **MS-C1342 Linear Algebra** taught at Aalto University, Finland.
    * The two textbooks **Linear Algebra** by Jim Hefferon and **Mathematics for Machine Learning** by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong.
