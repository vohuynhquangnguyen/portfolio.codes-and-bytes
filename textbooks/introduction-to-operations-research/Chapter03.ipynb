    "Denote $x$ as the number of tons of bands, and $y$ as the number of tons of coils should be produced. The number of tons produced for these two products must be (1) non-negative, (2) lesser or equal to the upper bounds, and (3) constrained by the production rate and the production time. Besides, our objective is to maximize the profits of these two products, which is given as: $25x + 30y$. \n",
