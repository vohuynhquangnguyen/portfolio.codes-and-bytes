## Section 5.1
### Problem 5.1.1
Recall that $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ is a joint probability distribution function of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ when it has the following properties:
* $f_{X,Y}\geq 0, \quad \forall x,y$
* $\sum_x\sum_y = 1, \quad \forall x,y$

According to the table, it is clear that these properties are satisfied. Hence, $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$ is a joint probability distribution function of $X$ and $Y$.

a. 
$$
P(X < 2.5, Y < 3) = f_{X,Y}(1.0, 1) + f_{X,Y}(1.5, 2) = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8
$$

b. 
$$
P(X < 2.5) = f_{X,Y}(1.0, 1) + f_{X,Y}(1.5, 2) + f_{X,Y}(1.5, 3) = 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/4 = 5/8
$$

c. 
$$
P(Y < 3) = f_{X,Y}(1.0, 1) + f_{X,Y}(1.5, 2) = 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8
$$

d. 
$$
$P(X > 1.8, Y > 4.7)

e. E(X), E(Y), V(X), V(Y)
